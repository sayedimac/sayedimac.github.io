# Bring your pets

### Top tips
- Do not put preassure on yourself to get them here ASAP. Rather ensure you are ready for them when they arrive.
- Work with a vendor - it is not cheap bu tit really is a lot less stress if you compare it to doing it yourself.
- No quarantine is required in the UK unless they find an issue.

### 1. Timing
- Your pet will essentially have to start the procedure for vaccination clearance at least three (3) months before they can get on the airplane.
- This makes it possible to fly at almost exactly the same time, but unless you have a place for them immediately, you might want to time this so the pets arive after you have got their accomodation in place (see below). 
- If you are coming over and have to find a place, then hold off with the pets if you can for a week or two/three. It can be stressfull having to find a place with a garden that allows pets for the price you want, in the suburb you want, etc.

### 2. The Process
- Your pets must be microchipped.
- They will get a set of injections irrespective of their current vaccine status
- After one month, they will be tested for antibodies. 
- If that is found sufficient, then they can travel after a further 2 months.

## 3. Obtain a Pet Passport or Health Certificate
- Get a pet passport or an official veterinary certificate.
- This document should include details of vaccinations and treatments.

## 5. Prepare for Quarantine (if applicable)
- Check if your pets need to undergo quarantine upon arrival.
- Make necessary arrangements for their stay.

## 6. Plan for Pet Accommodation
- Most sites will allow you to filter based on Pets or Garden, if not ask this first when enquiring about a property
- If your dog is properly house trained, a garden might not even be a necessity 

## 7. Register with a UK Veterinarian
- Find a local vet in the UK and register your pets.
- Schedule a health check-up soon after arrival.

## 8. Get Pet insurance 
- I am not kidding - it is worth it here especially if your pets are getting old. Could easily be Â£3000 to cut a lump out.
