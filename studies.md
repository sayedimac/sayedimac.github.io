# Studying in the UK: A Guide for Non-Permanent Residents

[Home](README.md)

## Studying Without Permanent Residency

As a person without permanent residency in the UK, you can still pursue education, but there are some key points to consider:

- **Visa Requirements**: You will need a student visa (Tier 4) to study in the UK. This requires an offer from a licensed Tier 4 sponsor, proof of funds, and English language proficiency.
- **Tuition Fees**: Non-residents typically pay higher tuition fees compared to UK residents. These fees vary depending on the institution and course.
- **Healthcare**: You will need to pay the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) as part of your visa application to access the National Health Service (NHS).

## Changes After Obtaining Permanent Residency

Once you obtain permanent residency (PR) in the UK, several aspects of studying will change:

- **Tuition Fees**: You may become eligible for home fee status, which means lower tuition fees.
- **Financial Aid**: Permanent residents can apply for student loans and grants that are not available to international students.
- **Work Opportunities**: With PR, you have fewer restrictions on working while studying, allowing you to support yourself financially.

## Differences Between Schools, Colleges, and Universities

- **Schools**: Primary and secondary education (ages 5-18). Non-residents may need to pay for private schooling, while public schools are generally free for residents.
- **Colleges**: Further education institutions offering vocational courses, A-levels, and other qualifications. Colleges may have different fee structures for non-residents.
- **Universities**: Higher education institutions offering undergraduate and postgraduate degrees. Universities have the most significant fee differences between residents and non-residents.

Understanding these differences and requirements will help you plan your educational journey in the UK effectively.
