## Right to Stay
Before you start looking for a house in the UK, ensure you have the right to stay. This typically involves having a valid visa or residency permit. Check the UK government's official website for detailed information on visa requirements and residency permits.

## Steps to Find a House

1. **Determine Your Budget**: Calculate how much you can afford to spend on rent or a mortgage each month.

2. **Choose a Location**: Research different areas to find a location that suits your needs in terms of work, schools, and amenities.

3. **Search for Properties**: Use online property portals like Rightmove, Zoopla, or local estate agents to find available properties.

4. **View Properties**: Schedule viewings to inspect the properties you are interested in.

5. **Check Legal Requirements**: Ensure you have the necessary documentation, such as proof of income, references, and identification.

6. **Make an Offer**: If you find a property you like, make an offer through the estate agent or landlord.

7. **Sign the Agreement**: Once your offer is accepted, sign the tenancy agreement or purchase contract.

8. **Move In**: Arrange for utilities and services to be set up in your new home and plan your move.
